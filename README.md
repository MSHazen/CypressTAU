This is just a personal project
the goal is to exercise my Cypress muscles as well as use the project as a crib sheet for later projects

Some tests are based on a public test web site:
https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/

Others are based on a AUT app from github
https://github.com/filiphric/cypress-tau-course
This should be run locally. It *could* be hosted, but NPM notes there are vulnerabilities
So I dont think its a good idea.
